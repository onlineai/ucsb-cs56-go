# Current steps to compile and run application 

**1. Create the database with mLab and MongoDB**

* Go into mLab and create a new database named go.
* In the repository, `cp env.sh.EXAMPLE env.sh` in order to make an env.sh file.
* In the go database create a new user and record the username and password into the env.sh file.
* Also record the name of database, host name, and port name which can be found in the go database page.
* In the database, create two collections (counters and places). 
* Add document in counters and add this code below
`
{
    "_id": "placeId",
    "seq": 0
}
`
* Your places collection should be empty.

**2. Add data to the database**  

* Go into the go repository. Type
`
. env.sh
`
in command line
* Type `mvn compile` and then `mvn exec:java`
* In a separate tab in command line, go into the testdata file (in the go repository)
* Typing `curl http://localhost:4567/api/places` should give you [ ] 
* Typing `curl -d @place1.json http://localhost:4567/api/places` should add the first place to the database
* Now when you type `curl http://localhost:4567/api/places` again, the first place and its id should show up. If you go into your places collection in your mLab database, you should see the first place. 
* Now redo `curl -d ...` but with place2 and place3

**3. Run the application**  
* If you type localhost:4567/api/places in your web browser's search bar, you should see the list of places that you have added
* If you type localhost:4567/ in the search bar and click on the places tab in the nav bar, you should see the list of places in a more readable format
